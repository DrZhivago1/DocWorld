    A mod of combined patches for my RimWorld mod collection "The Doctor's World". There are a lot of patches done to the various mods outlined in the "Changelog" in the "About" folder. I suggest you read there or GitHub for detailed information.
    
    The basics are: mod moves items to new tabs and organizes layout, balances some recipes for various items, enhances minaturisation abilities, improves inter-mod compatability.
