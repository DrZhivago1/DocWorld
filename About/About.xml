    A mod of combined patches for my RimWorld mod collection "The Doctor's World". There are a lot of patches done to the various mods outlined in the "Changelog" in the README.md.
    
    The basics are: mod moves items to new tabs and organizes layout, balances some recipes for various items, enhances minaturisation abilities, improves inter-mod compatability.
    
    Credits:
    Lanilor- for helping me learn xpath patching on the Discord.

    NotFood- for showing the way of the dragon.
