========
One of the most ambitious efforts to reorganize RimWorld/Mods into a cleaner, better functioning, and intuitive system. Originally started through my RimWorld mod collection [The Doctor's World](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1568763074). This mod patches, fixes, and adds content to many mods (including but not limited to plain old vanilla RimWorld).
