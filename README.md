# DocWorld
A mod of combined patches for Vanilla RimWorld, and my RimWorld mod collection [The Doctor's World](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1568763074).

The basics are: mod moves items to new tabs and organizes layout, balances some recipes for various items, enhances miniaturisation abilities, adds underground power conduits, improves inter-mod compatibility. There are a lot of patches done to the various mods outlined in the [Changelog](https://github.com/DrZhivago1/DocWorld/blob/master/README.md#changelog). I suggest you read there for detailed information.

# Save-Friendliness and Compatibility
__*Mod Compatibility*__
- Requires loading below ["Extended Storage Extended"](https://github.com/Terragg/Extended-Storage-Extended) if mod is used.
- Requires loading below ["FishIndustry"](https://github.com/Rikiki123456789/Rimworld/tree/master/FishIndustry/FishIndustry/FishIndustry) if mod is used.
- Requires loading below ["Gloomy Vanilla"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1697864590) if mod is used.
- Requires loading below ["Gloomy Vanilla Overhaul"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1883678698) if mod is used.
- Requires loading below ["Industrialisation"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1463579055) if mod is used.

__*Save Compatibility*__

There is only one patch that causes larger incompatibility. This incompatibility only exists IF you are using the mod "Dubs Bad Hygiene" AND "RF Fertile Fields". This is due to the fact that I remove biosolids and fertilizing from "Dubs Bad Hygiene". So it may break your current save-game, but more than likely there will only be a lot of errors generated upon first loading into an existing game. These errors occur due to any existing biosolids being deleted, as well as any soil previously fertilized with them. I've tested on-going saves with this patch, and my save was not broken by the changes made. New games will not suffer any issues other than 2 error logs generated at game start-up from the missing defs, but it is harmless. The errors look like: "Failed to find Verse.ThingDef named Biosolids. There are XXXX defs of this type loaded." **To remove that patch and allow this mod to be save-friendlier, navigate to "DocWorld/Patches" and find "DubsBadHygiene_RFFertileFields.xml" and then either hide it or delete it.**

The only other thing to note is that there may be some issues with floors/items going missing if you use various other mods. This *should* not be save-breaking, it means you need to redo your floors or may lose some redundant items from stockpiles. The more mods you use, the more likely it is to have complications on current saves. Use with caution.
