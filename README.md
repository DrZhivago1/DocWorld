# DocWorld
A mod of combined patches for my RimWorld mod collection [The Doctor's World](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1568763074). There are a lot of patches done to the various mods outlined in the "Changelog" in the "About" folder. I suggest you read there for detailed information. For a brief overview, the "Patches" folder has every patch named after the two mods/categories that are modified.

The basics are: mod moves items to new tabs and organizes layout, balances some recipes for various items, enhances minaturisation abilities, improves inter-mod compatability.


# Save-Friendliness and Compatibility
*A note for save compatibility*

There is only one patch that causes major save incompatibility. This incompatibility only exists IF you are using the mod "Dubs Bad Hygiene" AND "RF Fertile Fields". This is due to the fact that I remove all biosolids and composting elements. That means research, jobgivers, workdefs, defs... Everything related to them from "Dubs Bad Hygiene". So it may break your current save-game if you use both mods. New games will not suffer any issues other than 4 error logs generated from the missing defs, but they are harmless errors. The only other thing to note is that there may be some issues with floors going missing if you use various other mods along with "Stuffed Floors" by Fluffy. This is not save-breaking, it will only mean you need to redo your floors.

**To remove that patch and allow this patch mod to be save-friendly navigate to "DocWorld/Patches" and find "DubsBadHygiene_RFFertileFields.xml" and then either hide it or delete it.**
