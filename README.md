DocWorld
========
A mod of combined patches for Vanilla RimWorld, and my RimWorld mod collection [The Doctor's World](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1568763074).

The basics are: mod moves items to new tabs and organizes layout, balances some recipes for various items, enhances miniaturisation abilities, adds underground power conduits, improves inter-mod compatibility. There are a lot of patches done to the various mods outlined in the [Changelog](https://github.com/DrZhivago1/DocWorld/blob/master/README.md#changelog). I suggest you read there for detailed information.
